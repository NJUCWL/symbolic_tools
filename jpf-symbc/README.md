Symbolic PathFinder:
This is the new location for NASA's Symbolic PathFinder project which was originally at:
https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/projects/jpf-symbc.
The two copies will be kept in sync.

To compile and run the tool you will also need jpf-core which can be downloaded from here:
