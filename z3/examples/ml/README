Small example using the Z3 ML bindings.
To build the example execute
   make examples
in the build directory.

It will create ml_example in the build directory,
which can be run in the build directory via 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./ml_example
or
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./ml_example.byte
for the byte-code version.

If Z3 was installed into the ocamlfind package repository (see src/api/ml/README),
then we can compile this example as follows:

ocamlfind ocamlc -o ml_example.byte -package Z3 -linkpkg ml_example.ml
ocamlfind ocamlopt -o ml_example -package Z3 -linkpkg ml_example.ml

Note that the resulting binaries depend on the shared z3 library, which needs to be 
in the PATH (Windows), LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (OSX). If Z3 was 
installed into ocamlfind, the path that should be added is 
`ocamlfind printconf destdir`/Z3
