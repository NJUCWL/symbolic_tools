LIME Interface Test Bench (version 2.2.0)
=========================================

LIME stands for LightweIght formal Methods for distributed component-based 
Embedded systems. The main objective of the LIME project is to simplify the 
adoption of new design and validation methods for distributed embedded software
components in practice. The work will be based on the idea of an open tool 
framework that will try to integrate automated validation tools into the 
software development environment.

The test bench contains the following parts:

LIMT - LIME Interface Monitoring Tool
LCT  - LIME Concolic Tester 
LJUT - LIME JUnit Tools

Overview of the tools and instructions on how to use them can be found from 
a user guide located in /doc directory. Information about the tools can also be 
found from README files located in the /doc directory. 

The test bench can be used though command line or graphical user interface.
To start using the toolkit, set PATH environment variable to /bin directory.
(E.g., export PATH=$PATH:/home/exampleuser/limt/bin)

After setting the path, the gui can be started by command 'limegui'. See the
README files of the different tools or the user guide to learn how to use 
rest of the scripts located in /bin.
