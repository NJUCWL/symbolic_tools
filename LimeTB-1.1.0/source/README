Compiling the source code:
--------------------------

This folder contains the source codes of the various tools included in LimeTB.

aspect-monitor: LIME Interface Monitoring Tool (LIMT) for Java programs
common: LIMT functionality that is used by Java and C versions of LIMT 
cport: LIMT for C programs
limegui: The graphical user interface of LimeTB
ljut: JUnit and testdriver generation functionality 
tester: Lime Concolic Tester (LCT)
tracer: Tracer-utility that can be used with LIMT

The easiest way to compile the tools located in the folders explained above
is to download and install Maven (http://maven.apache.org/) as each of the 
source packages is a Maven project.

After Mavan has been installed, compiling the tools should be as easy
as to go to the directory of the source package that you want to compile and
run "mvn install" in that directory. However, you may need to add some of the
jar-files needed by LimeTB to your local maven repository. The jar-files in
question are located in LimeTB/lib/external/ directory. For instructions on
how to install these files to the local repository, see the instructions on
the Maven homepage.
